# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data 
## Overview of Project
-The Purpose of the analysis was to find the what different types of activities planned around the world and the goal decided by the company and how much 
 we were able to raise. We saw under different categories what was pledged by the people and if the pledge amount is near to the goal amount we saw that activity as successful

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

-The challenge i faces was trying to do some analysis and on one pivot i was trying to make two charts and the filters were changing for both and then figure out have to insert another pivot table to fix it.
Secondly, the COUNTIFS function i thought we dont have to edit the calculation you just copy till the bottom but not true, i watched hint video and was able to fix it.
