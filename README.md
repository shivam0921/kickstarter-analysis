# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data 
## Overview of Project
-The Purpose of the analysis was to find the what different types of activities planned around the world and the goal decided by the company and how much 
 they were able to raise. We saw under different categories what was pledged by the people and if the pledge amount is near to the goal amount we saw that activity as successful

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is gain insights into how different campaigns. In relation to their  dates and their goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

-
### Analysis of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
-Holiday season (December) is the month where we saw maximum decline in terms of failed to the no of total outcomes
-In the month of May and June the successful outcomes increase.
- On Average 60% are succesful outcomes in lieu of toatal outcomes


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Performed analysis using the Countifs functionality.
As the Goal amout rises the Failed outcomes percentage rises.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge i faces was trying to do some analysis and on one pivot i was trying to make two charts and the filters were changing for both and then figure out have to insert another pivot table to fix it.

Secondly, the COUNTIFS function i thought we dont have to edit the calculation you just copy till the bottom but not true, i watched hint video and was able to fix it.

Another challenge is encountered is to understand different concept or insight that can be taken out of data. We should have more data to do in depth analysis

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.Holiday season (December) is the month where we saw maximum decline in terms of failed to the no of total outcomes

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
  Not a real world exampales. And was not able to do indepth analyis and there can be other reasons why the huge fundraising goals were not able to reach.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
  1.Category / Sub-Category Statistics
  
  2.Maps based on the country
